# OMDB API SPA

This version of the OMDB API SPA utilizes the OMDB API and features:

1. DOM manipulation is used to display the OMDB API request and response.
2. Fetch is used to handle the Search button functionality.
3. A Reset button is used to reset the form fields.
4. The Request shows the request made to the OMDB API. The apiKey will not be shown to the user, but is used in the js file.
5. The Response will show movie information in JSON or XML format depending on user selection.
6. User is able to search based on a title string or imdbID.
7. User can select to display a short plot or long plot.
8. User can select to display the response in JSON or XML.
9. User will be shown an error message if an invalid title string or imdbID.

> **_NOTE:_** An easy way to test the imdbID search is to get the imdbID from a title search.
